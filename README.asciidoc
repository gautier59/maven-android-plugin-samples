=== Introduction

This project includes a whole number of example projects that use the
Android Maven Plugin available at
https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin[https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin].

It serves as samples for users as well as a test cases for the ongoing
development of the plugin.

Documentation can be found there as well as in README files in the folders
of the different examples.

To run all projects you will need the support library and other libraries from the
SDK deployed to your Maven repository. Use the https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer[Maven Android SDK Deployer] to do that.
